  },
  -- NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).
  'tpope/vim-sleuth', -- Detect tabstop and shiftwidth automatically

  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
  -- with the first argument being the link and the following
  -- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
  --
  -- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
  --
  --  This is equivalent to:
  --    require('Comment').setup({})

  -- "gc" to comment visual regions/lines
  { 'numToStr/Comment.nvim', opts = {} },

  -- Here is a more advanced example where we pass configuration
  -- options to `gitsigns.nvim`. This is equivalent to the following lua:
  --    require('gitsigns').setup({ ... })
  --
  -- See `:help gitsigns` to understand what the configuration keys do
  { -- Adds git related signs to the gutter, as well as utilities for managing changes
    'lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim',
    opts = {
      signs = {
        add = { text = '+' },
        change = { text = '~' },
        delete = { text = '_' },
        topdelete = { text = 'â€¾' },
        changedelete = { text = '~' },
      },
    },
  },

  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run lua code when they are loaded.
  --
  -- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
  -- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
  --
  -- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
  --  event = 'VimEnter'
  --
  -- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
  -- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
  --
  -- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
  -- after the plugin has been loaded:
  --  config = function() ... end

  -- NOTE: Plugins can specify dependencies.
  --
  -- The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well - anything
  -- you do for a plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.
  --
  -- Use the `dependencies` key to specify the dependencies of a particular plugin

  -- Highlight todo, notes, etc in comments
  { 'folke/todo-comments.nvim', event = 'VimEnter', dependencies = { 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim' }, opts = { signs = false } },
}
